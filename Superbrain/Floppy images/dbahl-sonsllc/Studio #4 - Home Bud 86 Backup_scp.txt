TO: American of Madison
RE: Computer Sales
     Let us 1st say that we realize that there is a
possibility that our letter may arrive after your computer
department has handled this problem, but we find it necessary
to speak out at this point before this goes on any longer.
     We purchased a Panasonic FX-600 from Rick Busse on
9/27/86.  We bought the computer with an understanding with
Rick that we wanted to connect it to the serial printer we
owned.  Rick at this point said there would be no problem,
and he would order the card that should arrive within ten
days.(10/7)
     October 7th arrived and needless to say the card did
not.  After another few days and phone calls he explained
that the company he had ordered the card from had a credit
hold on American.  He then said he would order the card
from Paradise in California, and it should arrive within a
week;  approximately 10/24.  We did receive this and were
assured by Rick that there would be no problem installing it
ourselves.  We took it home only to find it was not the right
module.  We called Rick and he assured us he would look into
it and reorder the part we needed and it should arrive in a
week.
     We called back a week later, which bring us to 11/14.
At this point we were informed Rick was no longer at
American.  A round trip for us to Madison and home is 100+
miles and a good 3 hrs. on the road; not to mention  the
countless moments of planning for baby-sitters and juggling
our time for these trips.  Also we will mention the now
mounting expense added to this with the numerous phone calls
required to establish the new personnel who would now pick up
where Rick left off and so on.
     Marty Hicky was the person who was given the task of
locating our card.  He discovered at this point that the
module Rick had gotten for our system was only 1/2 of what we
needed.  He told us the other 1/2 would be there in a
week.(11/21)  We went in there to meet Marty with hopes the
card had arrived, which it hadn't.  It was at this point we
inquired about any additional cost and were informed that the
card that Rick had planned for us would cost an additional
$100+.  Realizing we didn't need a 2nd color graphics card,
since there was one in the FX-600, we took the matter to
Elaine Lust.  She agreed the system Rick had planned for us
to connect the serial printer was an unnecessary expense and
that all we really needed was a serial card.  This is the
Friday before hunting season.
     At this point she prompted Marty to locate a card
through a competitor.  They assured us that there were cards
in stock and available and that we should bring our CPU in on
Monday (11/24) and they would install it for us.  Again
planning a trip to Madison is not a small task!  We are at
this point trying to put our business on our computer, and we
have had to make many additional trips to libraries and to
Madison to use other computers with printers.
     Monday (11/24) at 5:00pm we had our CPU packed up and
were 5 minutes away from driving our 3 hour trip to Madison,
and we receive a call from Marty casually informing us the
competitor would not sell the card to him, but not to worry
he would have the card located and purchased within a day or
two and would call us.  We spent half a day organizing this
trip trying to get baby-sitters and in 5 more minutes we
would have been on the road.  We never received this call.
     At which point we decided to contact Elaine again only
to find she was on vacation and were referred to John Martin,
who was unfamiliar with the details of our problem and would
track it down and get right back to us.  When we didn't hear
from him for a couple of days, we called and spoke with Gary
Johnson, who promptly went over to the computer department
and had John call us.  John explained that the serial card
was available in Madison and would have it in a couple of
days.  We also informed him we thought it would be advisable
to order a card form Panasonic in case it was not.
     We have not heard anything as of yet and are on our way
into Madison to meet with them in person again.  We bought
our computer in good faith, believing American had capable
salesmen who would give us prompt and complete service.  We
are trying not to become angry, but are very disappointed.
If this matter is not taken care of this week with some
reimbursement for our time and expense, we will refer this
matter to the Consumer Protection Agency of Madison.
                                   Sincerely,
                                   Katy and Michael Connors

RE:  Memory Expansion for Panasonic FX-600
We have recently purchased a Panasonic FX-600 from American
of Madison and are interested in expanding our memory from
256K to 640K.  We corresponded with you approximately two
weeks ago and you were prompt in supplying us with the

the exact ordering codes.  Unfortunately the 800 numbers were
not in service and we did not receive any addresses to write
to or any other possibilities.  Could you please have someone
send this to us or call with a more extensive list.
                                   Sincerely,

                       THE HUMAN ANIMAL
I am fascinated with everyone's opinion.  I enjoy assimilating
other's ideas and then am pleased that I am able to form my own
standing.  I believe that I am a centered nature-nurture
philosopher.  I very strongly believe we are born who we are, and
that our genes, which are so different from the next person, dictate
what will can be.   At the same time, I also believe that we are
capable of handling what nature dealt us in practically any way we
want;  that is if there is no permanent damage.
     I was very much interested in the isolation of MAO in deciding
if one person is more risk oriented than another.  I think it would
be equally beneficial to be able to isolate the enzyme that makes
one person more susceptible to the disease of alcoholism or similar
cunning and deceptive illnesses.  These facts in a world of
practically all seemingly unprovable theories gives me hope that I
am entering a field that will be able to come up with the answers we
will need to fulfill the needs of those who can't deal with what
nature dealt them or missed out on the nurturing the film so aptly
pointed out we all need.
     There is no doubt that we all need a certain amount of
nurturing to attain some degree of normalcy, but when I see what
people such as Mr. Glen Doman turn out at the Better Baby Institute,
I question what will become of that child.  Will he/she be in a
place that is just as detrimental as a child that has received too
little nurturing.  As we talked about in class, this show and
similar information, continues to bring up even more questions.  It
continues to amaze me that no matter what topic is dicussed there
are as many answers as there are people.  I enjoyed the film a great
deal and would recommend it for future classes for the benefit of a
very simple, clear presentation it offers of the examples of nature
and nuture sides of human life.

Can you believe all this information!  Just wait.  This is what
was talked about at the Leader's Meeting, which most of us find
impossible to attend.  If anyone can get there, please go.  I was
thinking that we could take turns, then everyone would only have to
go once.  How about it?  We could even team up so no one has to go
alone.  These night meetings are very hard.
Anyway this is how it goes.  For the Blue and Gold Dinner, the boys
are responsible for a few centerpieces for the table with the names
of the boys on them, writing an invitation for their parents, places
cards, and each family is asked to bring a dish to pass.  It can be
meat, vegetable or salad.  We also are responsible for an extra dish
of meat to feed the tiger cubs.  I thought we could choose up at the
Feb. 2 meeting.  If you want to make something special and can't be
there just call.  We will need ideas for the centerpieces before the
next meeting.  I thought maybe something with grapevines, candles,
bows, or some combination of the items.  We may need to check out a
craft book.  Also each family is responsible for their own table
setting (plate, fork, serving spoon etc.)   The parents need to RSVP
by the 14th so the information can be given at the Leader's Meeting.
One more thing.  The Pack Leaders will have an inspection and as the
kids enter the cafeteria they will be checked out for neatness,
proper clothing and that their badges are in the right place.  If
any one has any problem with that just call.
The Winterfest is something they do every year at the Golf Course in
Spring Green.  I believe it is winter sports events.  Any other kids
are invited as long as they are looked after.  It is from 1-4 p.m.
There will be a sign up for how many brothers and sister will come
along.
The first week of Feb. is Cub Scout week and they suggest that
anyone that attends a church, to ask the religious leader to say
something special or invite the cub scouts to do a part of the
service. They also suggest that is there are other kids in cub
scouts to have them sit together.  If your child is not interested
don't push it.  They can wear their uniform to the service.

        This is a gripping story of young five year old Michael Harris 
 and  his recovery with the help of the love and direction from his 
 therapist Pat McGarry.  This heartwarming story is well presented to 
 the layman in showing what the private world of a schizophrenic child 
 can be like.  I especially enjoyed the good feelings you received when 
 entering this tight little space that Mike had made for himself.              
        We find out that Mike had been an only child of a woman who most   
 probably had psychotic symptoms for alot of her life and had never rec-
 eived any medication to relieve her troubled nerves.  She was unable to 
 care for the child and ultimately was unable to even extend the much   
 needed physical contact a child needs to feel loved. Mike slowly pulled    
 himself into a world that contained only himself.  His father seemed to   
 be unable to acknowledge that there was anything wrong with his wife,   
 and besides his job, was totally hung up on the 'Power of God'.  Mike  
 is handed over to the care of Merrick State Psychiatric Hospital. 
 During his  next few years many tried to reach him and pull him into 
 the world of reality, but he remained the 'Little Shadow'.  
        Pat arrived and agreed to try Mike on for size as the child pro-
 ject he would be required to be responsible for.  The story centers 
 around a progressive love the two share, and the slow emergence of 
 Mike's ability to accept Pat's friendship.  The first breakthrough 
 comes when Mike finds himself in a moment of fear of falling and has 
 little choice but to accept the hand of his climbing partner.  We know 
 that Maslow talks about the needs that must be fulfilled before we can 
 go on to social relationships.  In this case the need to survive, 
 Mike's need, overpowered the false idea he had built up for himself 
 that it had to be done all alone.
